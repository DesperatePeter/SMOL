 *
 * The Material Design color system can help you create a color theme that reflects your brand or
 * style.
 *

 *
 * @property primary The primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your appâ€™s
 * screens and components.
 * @property primaryVariant The primary variant color is used to distinguish two elements of the
 * app using the primary color, such as the top app bar and the system bar.
 * @property secondary The secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your
 * product. Secondary colors are best for:
 * - Floating action buttons
 * - Selection controls, like checkboxes and radio buttons
 * - Highlighting selected text
 * - Links and headlines
 * @property secondaryVariant The secondary variant color is used to distinguish two elements of the
 * app using the secondary color.
 * @property background The background color appears behind scrollable content.
 * @property surface The surface color is used on surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets and
 * menus.
 * @property error The error color is used to indicate error within components, such as text fields.
 * @property onPrimary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the primary color.
 * @property onSecondary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the secondary color.
 * @property onBackground Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the background color.
 * @property onSurface Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the surface color.
 * @property onError Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the error color.
 * @property isDark Whether this Colors is considered as a 'light' or 'dark' set of colors. This
 * affects default behavior for some components: for example, in a light theme a [TopAppBar] will
 * use [primary] by default for its background color, when in a dark theme it will use [surface].
