/**
 * Alert dialog is a Dialog which interrupts the user with urgent information, details or actions.
 *
 * The dialog will position its buttons based on the available space. By default it will try to
 * place them horizontally next to each other and fallback to horizontal placement if not enough
 * space is available. There is also another version of this composable that has a slot for buttons
 * to provide custom buttons layout.
 *
 * Sample of dialog:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material.samples.AlertDialogSample
 *
 * @param onDismissRequest Callback that will be called when the user closes the dialog.
 * @param confirmButton A button which is meant to confirm a proposed action, thus resolving
 * what triggered the dialog. The dialog does not set up any events for this button so they need
 * to be set up by the caller.
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the layout of the dialog.
 * @param dismissButton A button which is meant to dismiss the dialog. The dialog does not set up
 * any events for this button so they need to be set up by the caller.
 * @param title The title of the Dialog which should specify the purpose of the Dialog. The title
 * is not mandatory, because there may be sufficient information inside the [text]. Provided text
 * style will be [Typography.subtitle1].
 * @param text The text which presents the details regarding the Dialog's purpose. Provided text
 * style will be [Typography.body2].
 * @param shape Defines the Dialog's shape
 * @param backgroundColor The background color of the dialog.
 * @param contentColor The preferred content color provided by this dialog to its children.
 * @param dialogProvider Defines how to create dialog in which will be placed AlertDialog's content.
