**Starsector Mod Organizer and Launcher (SMOL) Beta 1**

**BETA. It may crash. Some things, or everything, may not work. It *probably* won't delete your mods.**
**Windows only**
**400 MB (click the source code link to see why)**

__**Known issues**__: <https://github.com/davidwhitman/SMOL/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Abug>
- Doesn't start at all - try moving it out of your Starsector folder. Will fix if I can.
- Launching Starsector may result in a crash complaining about sound initialization (OpenAL), will be fixed in the next beta. Until then, launch Starsector normally, without SMOL.
- Browser is on top of everything, I have to wait for JetBrains to fix this.
- Having _any_ outdated version of a given mod installed causes an update warning to appear, even if you have the latest version of that mod. Will be fixed in next beta.

__**Features**__
* **Mod Browser** to view and install mods from the Forums and #mod_updates without leaving SMOL.
* Quickly **switch between mod versions**.
* **Mod Profiles** allow swapping between different groups of mods/versions easily.
  * Make a new profile for a new save, or keep a barebones profile for mod development.
* Easily assign more (or less) **RAM** to the game.
* **Auto-install JRE 8** for better performance and **switch JREs** with a click.
* **VRAM impact** estimates for each mod.
* **Version checker** support.
  * Supports Direct Download, for mods that have added it.
* Drag'n'drop or file browser **mod installation**.
  * Detects and fixes incorrect mod folder nesting.
* Warns and provides fixes for missing mod **dependencies**.
  * eg. if LazyLib is disabled, a button is shown to enable it. If it is not found, a button appears to search for it online.
* Works alongside manual mod management; you are **not locked into using SMOL**.
* Built-in and easily configurable **themes**.
* **Shortcuts** to your game folder, mods, saves, and log file.
* **Self-update** downloads only what's needed.
